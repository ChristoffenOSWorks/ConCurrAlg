# ConCurr Algebra
This is a project to make a graphical user interface, likely through Electron (or a Rust equivalent, if one exists) to an underlying math library. The overview of this project is detailed below.

## Teachers, sail easy!
The ConCurr Algebra is a project to test concurrent math in the short-term through the Rust programming language. The result of this project will be a web app in Electron, so you and everyone else can view cross-platform, regardless of your organization's restrictions.

The user interface will generate two PDFs (answers and corresponding worksheets) and will also generate quizes using portions from the library underneath, called "libalgebra-rs." Please note that generated sheets are NOT a replacement for standardized testing. Use at your risk.
